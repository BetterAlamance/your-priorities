Your Priorities is a web based platform that enables groups of people to share their ideas and together discover which are the most important ideas to implement by their communities. Users can add new ideas, add arguments for and against ideas, indicate if they support or oppose an idea, create a personal list of ideas and discuss all ideas. The end results are lists of top ideas in many categories as well as the best arguments for and against each idea. This service enables people to make up their minds about most issues in a short time.

See the main [Your Priorities](https://github.com/rbjarnason/your-priorities) repo for more info.
